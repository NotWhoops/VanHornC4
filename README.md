 // Manipulating the DOM 

 // made 10 different buttons that did 10 different things

// Peer Review: Lucas Guptill- Quite a bit of issues getting the buttons to work, i recommend going back over the code from the lecture and using those first few as a starter because i cant get any buttons working.
